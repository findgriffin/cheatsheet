On the sixth day, \emph{Stallman} did declare that sofware should be free. Free as in
speech. And \emph{Linus} did decree...

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\texttt{\%}&the \emph{stem}\\
\texttt{\$*}&stem matched by rule\\

\texttt{\$<}&first dependency\\

The community declared that Vi should be iMproved, and Vi was improved to
